# Machine-Learning-Driven-Forecasting-of-Traffic-Congestion
The ongoing urbanization has led to severe traffic congestion problems in the over populated cities like Dhaka which is affecting
transportation time, fuel consumption, mental health, environmental impacts like decreasing air quality and reducing productivity in
daily life by causing delay while reaching destination. The Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) has played a great role in developing
cities to resolve traffic problems and introducing a better traffic management system. This paper aims to improve traffic congestion
prediction in over crowded areas by analyzing data by Machine Learning based multi step prediction approach. Furthermore to provide
a more optimized prediction method and find a better route to reach the destination in order to increase productivity. Forecasting traffic
is mandatory to introduce a better system. This paper will take an approach which is a machine learning based and from research
we will try to predict traffic congestion with most efficiency. This research paper introduces a machine learning-based approach
to forecast and give more accurate traffic congestion predictions to take the faster route to save time which will also reduce fuel
consumption, avoiding routes with heavy traffic will also reduce risk of accidents. This applies to practical usage of the models as well.
